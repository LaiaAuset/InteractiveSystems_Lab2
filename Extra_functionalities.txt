Lab 2 - Interactive Systems - Laia Auset Rizo - 207345

In this document I will explain the extra funcionalities that I have implemented in the Unity project. 

First, when finishing implementing the Sheeps and all functions related to them, I created the part where when you hit a Sheep with a Hay Bale, the sheep dies and releases a heart object. This object is called Heart and has a Rotation and different implementations. 

I also implemented music, because its a better, and funny way to play the game!
